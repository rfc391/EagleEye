# EagleEye Project

## Overview
The EagleEye project processes and secures quantum signals using advanced cryptographic techniques. It demonstrates the serialization, encryption, and secure handling of quantum signal data.

## Features
- Quantum signal serialization and deserialization.
- AES-256 encryption for secure data transmission.
- Modular architecture for extensibility and clarity.

## Project Structure
```

├── core/                   # Core logic for quantum signal processing and encryption
├── configs/                # Configuration files for system setup
├── tests/                  # Unit tests for the project
├── main.py                 # Entry point of the application

```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd EagleEye-main
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure cryptography is installed:
   ```bash
   pip install cryptography
   ```

## Usage
To run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

This will serialize, encrypt, and display sample quantum signal data.

## Configuration
Update the `cloudflare_config.json` file with valid details:
```json
{
    "database_id": "<your-database-id>",
    "r2_storage_url": "<your-storage-url>",
    "api_key": "<your-api-key>"
}
```

## Testing
To run the unit tests:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description.
