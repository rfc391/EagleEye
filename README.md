# EagleEye Project

## Overview

EagleEye is a cutting-edge framework designed for secure, real-time processing and analysis of signals, with military-grade and DARPA-compliant capabilities. 
It integrates advanced technologies for quantum-safe encryption, decentralized storage, and AI-driven signal analysis.

## Key Features

- **Quantum Signal Processing**: Serialization, encryption, and secure handling of quantum signals.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Leverages NVIDIA Triton, OpenCV, and ONNX for real-time AI-driven insights.
- **EDA Framework**: Event-driven architecture built on Kafka and RabbitMQ for scalable data handling.
- **Security**: Zero Trust architecture, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).
- **Storage**: Decentralized archival with IPFS and immutable data storage using immudb.
- **Edge Computing**: Cloudflare Workers for performance optimization.
- **Compliance**: Fully aligned with ISO 27001/27701, GDPR, and DARPA standards.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js (for IPFS cluster)
- Redis and PostgreSQL

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rfc391/EagleEye.git
    cd EagleEye
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Set up the environment variables:
    ```bash
    cp config/example.env config/.env
    ```
    Update `.env` with your configurations.

4. Start the services:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the main application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
2. Access the centralized dashboard at `http://localhost:8000`.
