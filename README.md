# Quantum Signal Framework

This project demonstrates secure serialization and encryption for quantum signal data using a mock Protocol Buffer implementation.

## Features
- Efficient serialization and deserialization of quantum signal data.
- AES-256 encryption for secure data transmission.
- Simplified mock ProtoBuf schema for demonstration.

## Structure
- **src/**: Core implementation of the framework.
- **tests/**: Unit tests for the framework.
- **docs/**: Detailed usage instructions and examples.
